<notes>
	<p>This summarizes the rules associated with the additional 16 cards in the Base Set beyond the 10 recommended starter cards.</p>
	<p>Since you only use a random set of 10 cards for each game, you can't simply add these rules to the starter 10 cards and get a sensible number.</p>
	<p>However this does provide an upper bound answering the question: What if the rules for all 26 cards were used in a game?</p>
